# PRD: app-recovery

## Executive Summary

The app-recovery feature provides automatic detection and recovery mechanisms for the most common failure scenarios in ComfyUI-Launcher, particularly focusing on workflow import/validation errors that currently plague users. This system will implement intelligent retry logic, fallback strategies, and state recovery to ensure users can successfully import and run workflows even when facing network issues, dependency conflicts, or system crashes.

## Problem Statement

Users frequently encounter errors when importing and validating workflows, leading to:
- Failed imports that require manual intervention
- Lost progress during long model downloads
- Corrupted project states after crashes
- Inability to recover from transient network failures
- Frustration from having to restart entire processes

Currently, when an error occurs, users must often delete the project and start over, wasting time and bandwidth on re-downloading models.

## User Stories

### Primary Persona: Workflow User
**Sarah, Digital Artist**
- Wants to import complex workflows shared by the community
- Experiences frequent timeout errors when downloading large models
- Gets frustrated when a 4GB model download fails at 95%
- Needs clear guidance on fixing issues

**User Journey:**
1. Sarah finds an amazing workflow on ComfyWorkflows.com
2. Clicks import, download starts for multiple models
3. Network hiccup occurs during 3rd model download
4. CURRENT: Entire import fails, must restart
5. WITH RECOVERY: System retries failed download automatically, continues where it left off

### Secondary Persona: Power User
**Alex, Workflow Developer**
- Tests many workflows daily
- Needs to quickly recover from failed installations
- Wants to debug what went wrong
- Requires detailed logs for troubleshooting

**User Journey:**
1. Alex imports experimental workflow with cutting-edge nodes
2. Custom node installation fails due to dependency conflict
3. CURRENT: Project corrupted, manual cleanup required
4. WITH RECOVERY: System isolates failure, provides recovery options, preserves partial progress

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### FR1: Automatic Error Detection
- Monitor all import/validation operations for failures
- Categorize errors by type (network, validation, dependency, system)
- Track error frequency and patterns
- Detect partial completion states

#### FR2: Smart Retry Logic
- Implement exponential backoff for network failures
- Resume downloads from last successful byte
- Retry failed operations up to 3 times automatically
- Use alternative download sources when available

#### FR3: State Persistence
- Save import progress at each major step
- Store partial downloads with checksums
- Maintain recovery manifest for each project
- Enable resume from any failure point

#### FR4: Recovery Actions
- **Automatic Recovery:**
  - Network errors: Auto-retry with backoff
  - Validation errors: Attempt fix with common solutions
  - Download failures: Resume from last byte
  - Missing dependencies: Try alternative sources

- **Guided Recovery:**
  - Present clear error explanations
  - Offer one-click fix actions
  - Provide manual override options
  - Show recovery progress

#### FR5: Rollback Capability
- Create restore points before major operations
- Enable one-click rollback to last working state
- Preserve user data during rollback
- Clean up failed partial installations

#### FR6: Recovery UI
- Recovery status banner in main UI
- Dedicated recovery panel for active issues
- Progress indicators for recovery operations
- Success/failure notifications

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### NFR1: Performance
- Recovery checks add <100ms to operations
- Retry attempts start within 2 seconds
- State saves complete in <500ms
- No UI freezing during recovery

#### NFR2: Reliability
- Recovery system itself must not crash
- Graceful degradation if recovery fails
- No data loss during recovery attempts
- Idempotent recovery operations

#### NFR3: Storage
- Recovery data <10MB per project
- Automatic cleanup of old recovery data
- Efficient partial download storage
- Configurable retention period

#### NFR4: User Experience
- Clear, non-technical error messages
- Progressive disclosure of technical details
- Minimal user intervention required
- Consistent recovery patterns

## Success Criteria

1. **Error Resolution Rate**
   - 80%+ of network errors recover automatically
   - 60%+ of validation errors fixed without user intervention
   - 95%+ of downloads complete successfully with retry

2. **User Satisfaction**
   - 50% reduction in import-related support requests
   - 90%+ success rate for workflow imports
   - <5% of users need manual intervention

3. **Performance Metrics**
   - Average recovery time <30 seconds
   - <1% performance impact on successful operations
   - 99%+ recovery system uptime

4. **Data Integrity**
   - Zero data loss from recovery operations
   - 100% accurate state restoration
   - No corrupted projects from recovery

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints
- Must work within existing Python/Flask architecture
- Cannot modify ComfyUI core behavior
- Limited by filesystem permissions
- Network retry limited by upstream rate limits

### Assumptions
- Users have stable storage for recovery data
- Most errors are transient and recoverable
- Users want automatic recovery by default
- Network issues are the primary failure cause

## Out of Scope

- Recovery of user-generated content (images, outputs)
- Backup/restore of entire system state
- Cloud-based recovery storage
- Recovery from hardware failures
- Workflow version migration
- Database transaction recovery
- Multi-user conflict resolution

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- Python `requests` library retry functionality
- Filesystem atomic operations support
- Network connectivity for retries
- Model source API availability

### Internal Dependencies
- WebSocket system for progress updates
- Existing error handling infrastructure
- Storage management system
- Progress tracking components

## Technical Approach

### Architecture Overview
1. **Recovery Manager**: Central service coordinating recovery
2. **Error Classifier**: Categorizes and routes errors
3. **State Store**: Persists operation progress
4. **Recovery Strategies**: Pluggable recovery algorithms
5. **UI Components**: User-facing recovery interface

### Key Implementation Details
- Use SQLite for recovery state persistence
- Implement circuit breaker for failing sources
- Create recovery middleware for all operations
- Add recovery endpoints to API

## Rollout Plan

### Phase 1: Network Recovery (Week 1-2)
- Implement automatic retry for downloads
- Add resume capability for partial downloads
- Basic error classification

### Phase 2: State Persistence (Week 3-4)
- Create recovery state store
- Implement checkpoint system
- Add rollback capability

### Phase 3: Validation Recovery (Week 5-6)
- Smart validation error fixes
- Alternative source fallbacks
- Dependency conflict resolution

### Phase 4: UI Integration (Week 7-8)

## Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Recovery Loops
- **Risk**: Recovery attempts could loop infinitely
- **Mitigation**: Implement circuit breakers and max retry limits

### Risk 2: Storage Bloat
- **Risk**: Recovery data could consume significant space
- **Mitigation**: Automatic cleanup, size limits, user controls

### Risk 3: Complex Error Scenarios
- **Risk**: Some errors may be too complex for automatic recovery
- **Mitigation**: Fallback to guided manual recovery
