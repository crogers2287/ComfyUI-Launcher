# Task: Download Resume Enhancement

## Description
Enhance the model downloader with resume capability to support recovering interrupted downloads. This includes implementing partial file handling, adding checksum verification for download integrity, and ensuring downloads can be resumed from the last successful byte position.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Downloads can resume from interrupted state
- [ ] Partial files are properly detected and handled
- [ ] Checksum verification implemented for all downloads
- [ ] Download progress persists across app restarts
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] No performance regression

## Technical Details
- Modify the model downloader in backend to support HTTP range requests
- Implement partial file detection using file size comparison
- Add MD5/SHA256 checksum verification post-download
- Store download state in the persistence layer
- Key files to modify:
  - Model download logic in backend
  - Download progress tracking
  - File validation utilities
- Integration points:
  - State persistence system (Task 002)
  - Progress tracker enhancements

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001: State Persistence Layer (for storing download state)
- [ ] Task 002: Recovery Manager (for coordinating recovery)
- [ ] External dependencies: requests library range header support

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 16
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Integrated with existing systems
