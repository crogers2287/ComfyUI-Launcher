# Task: Integration & Testing

## Description
Integrate all recovery components and ensure comprehensive testing across the system. This includes applying recovery mechanisms to all long-running operations, implementing end-to-end testing scenarios, validating performance impact, and updating documentation to reflect the new recovery capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Recovery applied to all applicable operations
- [ ] End-to-end tests cover all recovery scenarios
- [ ] Performance metrics meet requirements (<5% overhead)
- [ ] Documentation complete and accurate
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] No performance regression

## Technical Details
- Apply recovery to operations:
  - Model downloads
  - Workflow imports
  - Installation processes
  - Long-running ComfyUI operations
- End-to-end test scenarios:
  - Network interruption during download
  - App crash during installation
  - Browser refresh during operation
  - Multiple concurrent recoveries
- Performance validation:
  - Measure overhead of state persistence
  - Verify checkpoint frequency impact
  - Test recovery time metrics
- Documentation updates:
  - User guide for recovery features
  - Technical architecture documentation
  - API documentation for recovery endpoints
- Key files to create/modify:
  - Test suite additions
  - Integration test scenarios
  - Performance benchmarks
  - Documentation files
