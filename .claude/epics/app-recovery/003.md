# Task: Error Classification System

## Description
Build an error classification system that categorizes exceptions and maps them to appropriate recovery strategies. The system will detect error patterns, classify them into categories (transient, permanent, resource-related, etc.), and determine the best recovery approach. This module integrates with the recovery decorator to provide intelligent error handling.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Error categorizer module that classifies exceptions into predefined categories
- [ ] Recovery strategy mapping based on error classification
- [ ] Pattern detection for common error scenarios
- [ ] Configurable classification rules
- [ ] Support for custom error classifiers
- [ ] Integration with recovery decorator from task 001
- [ ] Unit tests with 95%+ coverage
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach details
  - Create hierarchical error classification system
  - Use pattern matching for error detection
  - Implement strategy pattern for recovery approaches
  - Support for ML-based classification in future iterations
- Key files to modify or create
  - `backend/recovery/classification/classifier.py` - Main classifier implementation
  - `backend/recovery/classification/categories.py` - Error category definitions
  - `backend/recovery/classification/patterns.py` - Error pattern matchers
  - `backend/recovery/classification/strategies.py` - Recovery strategy mappings
- Integration points
  - Must integrate with recovery decorator from task 001
  - Should use error context from the decorator's error wrapper
  - Compatible with existing error monitoring systems

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task dependencies as specified
  - [ ] Task 001: Recovery Decorator Implementation
- [ ] External dependencies (if any)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 8
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Integrated with existing systems
