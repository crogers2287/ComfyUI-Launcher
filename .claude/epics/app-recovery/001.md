# Task: Recovery Decorator Implementation

## Description
Implement a Python decorator that provides recovery capabilities for critical application functions. The decorator will handle retries with exponential backoff, provide a state persistence interface for recovery data, and wrap functions with comprehensive error handling. This forms the foundation of the recovery system.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Recovery decorator with configurable retry attempts and backoff strategy
- [ ] State persistence interface defined and documented
- [ ] Error handling wrapper that captures and categorizes exceptions
- [ ] Decorator supports both sync and async functions
- [ ] Configurable timeout and circuit breaker functionality
- [ ] Unit tests with 95%+ coverage
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach details
  - Create `@recoverable` decorator with parameters for max_retries, backoff_factor, timeout
  - Abstract state persistence interface using Protocol or ABC
  - Error wrapper should capture stack traces and context
  - Support for custom recovery strategies per function
- Key files to modify or create
  - `backend/recovery/decorator.py` - Main decorator implementation
  - `backend/recovery/interfaces.py` - State persistence interface
  - `backend/recovery/strategies.py` - Recovery strategy definitions
- Integration points
  - Should integrate seamlessly with existing error handling
  - Compatible with current logging infrastructure
  - Works with both Flask routes and background tasks

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task dependencies as specified
