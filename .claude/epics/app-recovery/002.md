# Task: SQLite State Persistence

## Description
Implement SQLite-based state persistence for the recovery system. This includes designing the database schema for storing recovery state, implementing CRUD operations for state management, and creating migration scripts for schema versioning. The persistence layer will store function execution state, retry attempts, and recovery metadata.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] SQLite schema designed for recovery state storage
- [ ] CRUD operations implemented for state management
- [ ] Migration script for initial schema creation
- [ ] Support for storing serialized function arguments and results
- [ ] Cleanup mechanism for old recovery states
- [ ] Transaction support for atomic state updates
- [ ] Unit tests with 95%+ coverage
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach details
  - Use SQLAlchemy for database operations
  - Schema should include tables for recovery_state, retry_attempts, error_logs
  - Implement connection pooling for concurrent access
  - Use JSON columns for flexible metadata storage
- Key files to modify or create
  - `backend/recovery/persistence/sqlite.py` - SQLite implementation
  - `backend/recovery/persistence/models.py` - SQLAlchemy models
  - `backend/recovery/persistence/migrations/001_initial.py` - Initial migration
  - `backend/recovery/persistence/repository.py` - Repository pattern implementation
- Integration points
  - Implements the state persistence interface from task 57
  - Must work with existing database configuration
  - Should use the app's logging system

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task dependencies as specified
- [ ] External dependencies (if any)
  - SQLAlchemy
  - alembic (for migrations)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 16
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Integrated with existing systems
