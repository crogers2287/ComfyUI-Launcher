# Task: Progress State Enhancement

## Description
Extend the progress_tracker.py module to support recovery checkpoints and state persistence. This includes adding checkpoint creation at key operation milestones, implementing state persistence calls throughout the progress lifecycle, and ensuring WebSocket events are properly emitted for recovery status updates.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Progress tracker creates checkpoints at key milestones
- [ ] State persistence integrated into progress updates
- [ ] WebSocket events emit recovery status
- [ ] Progress can be restored from saved state
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] No performance regression

## Technical Details
- Extend progress_tracker.py with checkpoint functionality
- Add state persistence calls at:
  - Operation start
  - Key milestones (25%, 50%, 75%)
  - Operation completion
- Implement WebSocket event types:
  - recovery.checkpoint.created
  - recovery.state.restored
  - recovery.progress.updated
- Key files to modify:
  - backend/progress_tracker.py
  - WebSocket event handlers
  - State persistence integration
- Integration points:
  - State persistence layer (Task 002)
  - WebSocket communication layer
  - Frontend progress components

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 002: Recovery Manager (for state persistence API)
- [ ] External dependencies: None

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 8
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Integrated with existing systems
