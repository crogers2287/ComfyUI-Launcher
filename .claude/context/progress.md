### Working Directory Status
The project has significant uncommitted changes:
- **Modified files**: Multiple configuration files (package.json, requirements.txt) and frontend components
- **Deleted files**: Entire server/ directory structure appears to have been removed
- **Untracked files**: New backend/ directory structure, test files, and various debug/utility scripts
- **Major restructuring**: Appears to be a significant refactor moving from server/ to backend/

## Current Work Focus

### Apparent Refactoring in Progress
1. **Directory Structure Migration**: Server code moved from `server/` to `backend/src/`
2. **Frontend Updates**: Multiple React components modified
3. **Testing Infrastructure**: Numerous test files added for various scenarios
4. **Build System**: New build and restart scripts added

### Testing Coverage
Extensive test files have been added covering:
- Import workflows
- Model detection
- UI validation
- Frontend error handling
- Complete workflow testing
- Puppeteer/browser automation tests

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. **Commit Current Changes**: Large refactor needs to be committed
2. **Test Suite Validation**: Run all new tests to ensure functionality
3. **Documentation Update**: Update docs to reflect new structure
4. **CI/CD Integration**: New GitHub workflow file needs configuration

### Technical Debt
1. Clean up temporary test files
2. Remove debugging scripts after stabilization
3. Update README to reflect actual project (currently shows Claude Code PM)
4. Address the numerous "wip" commits with proper messaging

## Development Environment

### Active Development Files
- Multiple Puppeteer test scripts
- Debug utilities for frontend state
- Workflow import testing
- Model auto-download functionality

### Log Files Present
- launcher.log
- server.log
- celery.log
- Various test output logs

## Integration Points

### Claude Code PM System
The project has been integrated with Claude Code PM system as evidenced by:
- `.claude/` directory structure
- PM-specific CLAUDE.md rules
- Git worktree workflow preparation
