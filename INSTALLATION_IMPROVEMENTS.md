# ComfyUI-Launcher Installation System Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive improvements made to the ComfyUI-Launcher dependency installation system to make it bulletproof and ensure all dependencies are installed correctly the first time.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Download Manager
- **Parallel Downloads**: Downloads up to 3 files concurrently for faster installation
- **Resume Support**: Interrupted downloads can be resumed from where they left off
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff for failed downloads (up to 5 attempts)
- **Connection Error Handling**: Specific handling for network connectivity issues
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress updates with throttled callbacks
- **Checksum Verification**: All downloads are verified against SHA256 checksums
- **File Caching**: Detects existing files with matching checksums to avoid re-downloads
- **Hard Link Optimization**: Uses hard links when possible to save disk space

### 2. Robust Custom Node Installation
- **Dependency Resolution**: Automatically detects and installs all node dependencies
- **Error Recovery**: Continues installation even if some dependencies fail
- **Special Case Handling**: Handles edge cases like ComfyUI-CLIPSeg
- **Git Integration**: Properly clones repositories with specific commits
- **Requirements Management**: Handles both requirements.txt and requirements_post.txt
- **Install Scripts**: Executes custom install.py scripts when present

### 3. Comprehensive Validation System
- **Model Validation**: Verifies all model files have correct checksums
- **Custom Node Validation**: Ensures all nodes are properly installed
- **Python Package Validation**: Checks that all required packages are installed
- **Detailed Reporting**: Provides comprehensive validation reports
- **Success Metrics**: Tracks overall installation success rate

### 4. Error Handling & Recovery
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues even if some components fail
- **Detailed Error Messages**: Clear information about what went wrong
- **Automatic File Renaming**: Handles conflicts with existing files
- **Partial Installation Support**: Can complete partially failed installations

### 5. Progress & Status Updates
- **Real-time Status**: Updates launcher state with current operation
- **Download Progress**: Per-file download progress tracking
- **Installation Phases**: Clear indication of current installation phase
- **Failure Tracking**: Records all failed downloads and installations

## Technical Details

### New Classes and Components

1. **DownloadTask**: Data class representing a download with metadata
2. **DownloadManager**: Handles all file downloads with advanced features
3. **CustomNodeDependencyResolver**: Manages custom node installation
4. **InstallationValidator**: Validates the complete installation

### Configuration Constants
```python
MAX_DOWNLOAD_ATTEMPTS = 5  # Increased from 3
DOWNLOAD_RETRY_DELAY = 2   # seconds between retries
DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT = 300     # 5 minutes per file
MAX_CONCURRENT_DOWNLOADS = 3
CHUNK_SIZE = 1024 * 1024   # 1MB chunks for better performance
```

### Key Functions Updated
- `setup_files_from_launcher_json()`: Now uses parallel downloads
- `setup_custom_nodes_from_snapshot()`: Better dependency handling
- `compute_sha256_checksum()`: Optimized with larger buffer size

## Usage Example

```python
# The system now provides detailed feedback during installation
launcher_json = get_launcher_json_for_workflow(workflow_json)

# Install with progress tracking
def progress_callback(file_path, downloaded, total):
    print(f"Downloading {file_path}: {downloaded}/{total} bytes")

failed_downloads = setup_files_from_launcher_json(
    project_path, 
    launcher_json,
    progress_callback
)

# Validate installation
validator = InstallationValidator(project_path)
results = validator.validate_all(launcher_json)
validator.print_validation_report()
```

## Benefits

1. **Reliability**: Downloads complete successfully even with network issues
2. **Performance**: Parallel downloads significantly reduce installation time
3. **Transparency**: Users know exactly what's happening and what failed
4. **Robustness**: System handles edge cases and continues despite failures
5. **Verification**: Ensures all components are correctly installed

## Testing

A comprehensive test suite (`test_installation_system.py`) has been created to verify:
- Download manager functionality
- Custom node installation
- Validation system
- Integration scenarios
- Stress testing with concurrent downloads

## Future Enhancements

1. **Mirror Support**: Automatic fallback to mirror servers
2. **Bandwidth Limiting**: Option to limit download speed
3. **Dependency Graph**: Visual representation of dependencies
4. **Rollback Support**: Ability to undo failed installations
5. **P2P Downloads**: Torrent support for large model files
